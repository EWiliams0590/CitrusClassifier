# CitrusClassifier

I used this mini-project as a way to explore different classification models, using Grid Searches for optimizing hyper-parameters, creating new features, based not only on polynomial expansion of the original features, but custom creations as well.

Ultimately, with using the dataset provided, and only keeping columns related to weight and diameter of the citrus (grapefruit or orange), by reducing to adding simply one feature column, I was able to achieve an XGBoostClassifier model with over 99.7% accuracy on the hold-out/test set.
